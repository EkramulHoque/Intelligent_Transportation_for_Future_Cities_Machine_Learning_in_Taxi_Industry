1. Install chartify using pip or conda

2. upload both the dataset 'data-all_training.csv' and 'data-all_test_set_1.csv'

3. Replicated Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression from the given code and added
Multilayer Perceptron and Stochastic Gradient Classifier to compare the trained models.

4. Two files are exported:
	a) model_comparison.csv
	b) prediction.csv

5. Created bar plot to show supply-demand gap vs date-time
